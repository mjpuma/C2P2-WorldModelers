  "body": "Our global food system is vulnerable to climate extremes, including severe droughts, floods, heat waves and cold spells.  It is well understood that climate change will potentially magnify this vulnerability through changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of these extreme, all of which can affect crop production.  Yet a new source of susceptibility has emerged as trade flows, interconnectivity, and homogeneity have increased within the global food system.  On the surface, globalization of our food system balances supply and demand across different regions, provides protection against regional disturbances, and leads to a more efficient global system.  However, evidence is emerging that the high interdependency and homogeneity within the system also leaves it susceptible to catastrophic disruptions. ",
